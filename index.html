      <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Sammy Decker</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Sammy Decker, a senior at Colorado School of Mines, where I'm pursuing a degree in <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span> with a minor in <span class="highlight">Computational and Applied Math</span>. I'll be graduating in May 2025 and am excited to apply my skills in software development, data analysis, and problem-solving to real-world challenges.
        <br><br>
        As a Colorado native, I have a strong appreciation for both the outdoors and technology. When I'm not coding, you'll find me rock climbing, biking, lifting, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I also share my space with Frankie, my cat, who keeps things interesting at home.
        <br><br>
        I'm passionate about learning, tackling complex problems, and creating solutions that make an impact. I'm eager to connect with potential employers and contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.
